# AI Literacy Lesson Planner Tool

A project for MIT Media Lab [MAS.S10: Generative Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education](https://mit-cml.github.io/gen-ai-fall-2023.github.io/) by Shrestha Mohanty, Elinor Poole-Dayan, and Swati Garg.


## Motivation 
- There is a growing need for AI literacy in younger students as AI tools are increasingly accessible
- Not all schools (especially public schools) have the resources, expertise, or time to develop and incorporate specialized AI literacy programs for students
- As usage of generative AI tools in education becomes more prevalent, it is important to learn about AI literacy in multiple contexts
- AI literacy will look differently depending on the field, so we want specific activities tailored to each of these domains to reflect that

### Solution: 

Specialized/customized AI Literacy lessons relevant to the topics being discussed and tools being used in middle school classrooms
However, many teachers do not have the expertise or capacity to develop new curricula!

## What will our tool do?

- Generative AI tool to aid teachers incorporate AI literacy into their classes
- Features of the tool:
  - A simple form for the educator to specify the topic and other lesson parameters they need
  - A domain-specific lesson plan is automatically developed which incorporates AI literacy activities
- Activities can be modified as necessary (LLM chatbot interface)
- This will allow educators to more easily come up with a course plan to teach students AI concepts and how to interact with these tools safely
- The tool is designed to be open ended and thus can be used across a variety of academic disciplines and topics such as science, history, english literature, arts, etc
