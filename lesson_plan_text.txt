TITLE
What is Physical Computing?

OVERVIEW
In this lesson, students will be introduced to the concept and the focus areas of Physical Computing. They will analyze how they interact with the technology around them and begin work in their design journals which they will decorate in this lesson and use throughout the course to document their work.

Learning Objectives
Students will be able to
Understand the focus areas of Physical Computing
Describe how a computing device works
Identify an Input - Process - Output system  
Explain their roles in physical computing class 


DISCUSSION
Title:
Physical Interactions Around Us

Description:
Hand out a worksheet. 
On the worksheet, students will be tasked with the following:
Think of a typical weekday and pick one object or device that you used in your house or classroom.
What object did you pick?
Describe the object and how it works. 
How did you interact with the object or device?
Which body part did you use—hands, feet, or face?
What type of action did you take? Think of verbs that describe your action—touch, turn, squeeze, or kick?
Use these sample answers (Sample 1, Sample 2) and demonstrate how students can work on the worksheet.

ACTIVITY
Title:Physical Interactions Around Us

Description:
Ask students to complete the worksheet. 
Once students are done with independent work with the worksheet, ask them to share their object or device with their neighbors. 
Conclude this activity addressing the following items.
These interactions were designed by people and could have been designed to operate differently. (For example, an engineer can build a fan that turns on when you kick it.)
We are going to design physical interactions with computers and will need to determine which actions are best suited to trigger specific responses from the computer.
